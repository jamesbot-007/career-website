Before we go further and code the site directly it might be easy if we first figure out what exactly we want to show on the page, this is the time when we put laptop away and use pen and paper and try to what you want to display on page before we actually try to code.
If we don't have clear picture of what we want then writting a code worried and be get some what tricky 

for that we use a virtual white board : https://excalidraw.com/
we created : https://excalidraw.com/#json=5FRsxUEW6pzHKXBe5MchY,vJz7T8LGStN1FTg5lKpw8A
we can another 2 wireframes (i) (After click on apply) job, require, salary , Application form
                            (ii) (After submitting Application form) Your application has been submitted page
                            
i.e. https://excalidraw.com/#json=rGB215Ka1I0dbWhLxaJKn,xCinmKb3TucX4FQk9ht72w

This is called wireframing. you create a ruff idea for your site how it looks like.
we can either convert it to in detailed design or start coding direcly.

Let's start create website.
