# Let's see you have done some work on replit now you want to save it on github so, how can we do.

- goto github repo
  - It doesn't have those changes we made on replit

- so, as we do some devlopment locally and then we push to github same way here, We have git (version control tab) in tools section of Explorer

- stage the files and commit
- click on "sync with remote" or "push" to push on remote repo

- go back to github and reload the page

=> We have bunch of files but most importantly we have app.py file.
